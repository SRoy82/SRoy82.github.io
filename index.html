<p>I am delighted to write this letter of recommendation for Subhasish Roy, a highly skilled and results-driven Technical Project Manager with whom I had the privilege of working at Comerica Bank on the Wire Fraud and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) solution.

He led the projectâs execution with precision, ensuring seamless coordination between cross-functional teams, including IT Security, Compliance, and Vendor Management. His ability to navigate complex regulatory requirements while maintaining efficient project timelines was instrumental in achieving the bankâs fraud prevention objectives.

One of Subhasishâs standout contributions was his leadership in rolling out an Identity and Access Management (IAM) framework, enhancing security protocols to prevent unauthorized access and fraudulent transactions. His proactive approach in fostering vendor relationships and contract negotiations ensured strict adherence to service level agreements (SLAs), optimizing system performance and reliability.

Beyond his technical capabilities, Subhasish is an outstanding communicator and problem solver. His ability to engage stakeholders at all levels, from executive leadership to technical teams, was key to maintaining alignment and driving project success. He is detail-oriented, highly organized, and possesses a strong analytical mindset, making him a valuable asset in any organization looking to enhance its security and compliance framework.
